To whom it may concern,

It’s my absolute pleasure to recommend Jackie Curtsinger to work for you. She worked with us at Walmart DC 6037 as an Area Manager and worked with me as my mentee. 

Jackie was a highly valued member of the team and made a strong contribution during her time at Walmart. Jackie is honest, dependable, and incredibly hard-working. Jackie is also an impressive leader who is always striving to excel.

Along with her undeniable talent, Jackie has always been an absolute joy to work with. She quickly gained the respect and trust of colleagues and was admired for her reliability and collaborative spirit.

I confidently recommend Jackie to join your team. I am sure that she will be a great addition to your organization. Her background and experience should be a good match for the position.

I am available and happy to discuss should you have any further questions about Jackie’s qualifications. Please feel free to contact me at travismalin@dekeswaterfowl.com. Thank you for your time.
 
Sincerely,

Travis Malin
