Dear Sir or Madam,
	It was a pleasure working with Jackie Curtsinger during her with Keystone R.V. Jackie quickly proved herself to be quick learner that motivated those around her, working diligently to advance within the company. She was promoted to lead our largest department producing the number one selling fifth wheel in the country. During her time here she developed her team and helped her peers improving her department's efficiency, quality, and turnover rate. Jackie always strived to make processes easier and more stream line. Our current inventory system was created by her among other things. Jackie has a knack for streamlining processes. I know that she will make a great addition to any team.

Thank you,
Chuck U. Emery
Director of Manufacturing
