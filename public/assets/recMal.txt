To Whom It May Concern, 


I am writing a recommendation for Jackie Curtsinger. I had the pleasure of directly managing Jackie at the Walmart Distribution Center and her abilities never ceased to amaze me. While working with Jackie she was a strong member on the team and natural leader. I am very familiar with her capabilities and strengths. 

Jackie’s incredible organization and willingness to lead made her an excellent not only area manager but working peer. She was always jumping in to help her associates and teach those around her. She truly saw the big picture and how to succeed long term without sacrificing short term gains. She has always been flexible and understanding even when she wasn’t sure of the answer. 

Jackie is also very capable of working effectively with co-workers, making her a great addition to the team. She took initiative on multiple occasions to assist peers who were struggling or who were new to the team. 

One of the most memorable accomplishments from Jackie was not only her ability to drive the team she was managing but in the development of her peers. She took it upon herself to set up and manage a shared library where managers and associates could share and check out leadership books to develop themselves. This was only a piece of how she always strives to think outside the box and be inclusive of those around her. 

With her abilities, dedication, adaptability, and great attitude Jackie would make a great member of any team. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me directly.

Sincerely,
