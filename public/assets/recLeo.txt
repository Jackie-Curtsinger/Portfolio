To whom it may concern, 
I had the opportunity and privilege to work with Jackie Curtsinger for 5 years when we both were area managers at Walmart Distribution Center 6037 in  Hermiston Oregon. 
I was initially impressed with Jackieâ€™s professionalism and leadership. She has impressive interpersonal communication skills and is very outspoken to give creative ideas. She also is very analytical and dedicated to find solutions to any problem. Jackie has a great personality and an untouchable character.  She is super responsible, dedicated, and has exceptional technical skills. 
In conclusion, I would highly recommend Jackie Curtsinger, she truly is an amazing person that will always do her very best to go above and beyond in her profession. 
If you need any additional information feel free to contact me by phone or email at any time. 

Sincerely, 

Leovardo Diaz.
