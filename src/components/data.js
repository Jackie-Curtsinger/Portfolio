  aboutPara:
	"I am a fullstack web developer looking to create an incredible user experience. My love of skill acquisition has brought me down the path of web development because there is always something new to learn.  Coding provides me with a way to help others effectively communicate what they or their business has to offer the world. As a detail-oriented honors graduate from Nucamp, I have successfully demonstarted abilities in multiple languages and frameworks. This knowledge paired with my extensive experience in eCommerce, logistics, and data-analitics help me to easily create solutions for client's goals.",
