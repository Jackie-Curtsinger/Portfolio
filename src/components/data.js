	"My love of skill acquisition has brought me down the path of web development because there is always something new to learn.  Coding provides me with a way to help others effectively communicate what they or their business has to offer the world. As a detail-oriented honors graduate from Nucamp, I have successfully demonstarted abilities in multiple languages and frameworks. This knowledge paired with my extensive experience in eCommerce, logistics, and data-analitics help me to easily create solutions for client's goals.",
