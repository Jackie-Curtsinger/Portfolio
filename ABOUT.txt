	 'I live by two mantras in life.  "I believe in my ability to figure things out" & "Take life seriously enough to bring joy and fun to each day."'

	'I am a fullstack web developer looking to create an incredible user experience. My love of skill acquisition has brought me down the path of web development because there is always something new to learn.  Coding provides me with a way to help others effectively communicate what they or their business has to offer the world. As a detail-oriented honors graduate from Nucamp, I have successfully demonstarted abilities in multiple languages and frameworks. This knowledge paired with my extensive experience in eCommerce, logistics, and data-analitics help me to easily create solutions for client's goals.' 

My twelve years of management experience encompasses building winning teams, procedural development, conceptualizing, and implementing strategies to ensure success. 
 
As an analytical detail-oriented individual, I can easily create solutions for clients' goals. Achieving various business targets and contributing to the overall performance of the team is a constant for me. I have had the privilege of developing extensive experience in eCommerce, logistics, data analytics, and customer service.
 I want to take that desire, that passion, to build some of the best websites that this world has seen.
